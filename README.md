### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
<p>
  Iâ€™m 21 years old. Iâ€™m a web development student, and Iâ€™ve recently studied Graphic Design in college. <br><br>   
My two years academic experience in design developed in me a highly meticulous sense of aesthetic, along with an exceedingly attention to every single detail, which is distinctly reflected on my web development projects.<br><br>  
Iâ€™m looking forward to taking my very fist steps in the IT professional world, so I can increase my knowledge by learning as much as possible in a professional environment.

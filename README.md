### Hi there 👋
<p>
My name is Rodrigo. I'm from Argentina and <strong>I’m looking to become the greatest developer I can possible be.</strong> <br><br> 
I’m 21 years old. I’m a web development student, and I’ve recently studied Graphic Design in college. <br><br>   
My two years academic experience in design developed in me a highly meticulous sense of aesthetic, along with an exceedingly attention to every single detail, which is distinctly reflected on my web development projects.<br><br>  
I’m looking forward to taking my very fist steps in the IT professional world, so I can increase my knowledge by learning as much as possible in a professional environment.
</p>

- 🔭 I’m currently working on building an ecommerce as a final project for my JavaScript course on Coderhouse.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Javascript.

## About me
    
  <p>
      I’m highly perfectionist, analytical and flexible, but most importantly I’m remarkably meticulous. I’ve got a C1 English level. I’m fluent in both speaking and writing, as I’ve been studying since I was a kid. I also consider that I have great soft skills, such as communication, team-oriented personality and decisiveness, among others.

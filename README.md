### Hey what's up 👋👋👋
<p>
My name is Rodrigo. I'm from Argentina and I'm looking forward to fulfil a single goal: <br>
  <h3>To become the greatest developer I can possible be.</h3>(As cliché as it may sound) <br> <br>  
I’m 21 years old. I’m a web development student, and I’ve recently studied Graphic Design in college. <br>  
My two year academic experience in design developed in me a highly meticulous sense of aesthetic, along with an special close attention to every detail, which is distinctly reflected on my web development projects.<br><br>  
I’m looking forward to taking my very fist steps in the IT professional world, so I can increase my knowledge by learning as much as possible in a professional environment.
</p>

- 💡 I’m currently learning Javascript.
- 🔭 I’m currently working on building an ecommerce as a final project for my JavaScript course in Coderhouse. (https://unfamiliar.netlify.app/)

## About me 📚📚📚
    
  <p>
      I’m highly perfectionist, analytical and flexible, but most importantly I’m remarkably meticulous. I’ve got a C1 English level. I’m fluent in both speaking and writing, as I’ve been studying since I was a kid. I also consider that I have great soft skills, such as communication, team-oriented personality and decisiveness, among others.
